# MikroORM migrations directory

This directory stores MikroORM migration files that track changes to your database schema over time.

## Note

Your schema is primarily managed by **Supabase migrations** in the `/supabase/migrations` directory. 

MikroORM migrations here are used to:
- Track entity-level changes for TypeScript/ORM purposes
- Keep your TypeScript entities in sync with the database
- Handle migrations when Supabase is not available

**Recommendation:** Use Supabase migrations as the source of truth for schema changes.
